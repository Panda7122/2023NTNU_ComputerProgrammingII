1.wchar_t is not as widely support as the char data type, 
  particularly in older systems or on embedded devices. 
  it mean that wchar_t will limit the portability of the code
2.wchar_t size is unfixed, 
  in Windows API and Visual Studio Compiler is 16 bits, 
  but it is 32 bits in Unix-like System
3.it take up more memory than char, 
  This can be a concern if you are working with large amounts of text or 
  if memory usage is a critical consideration in your application
4.wchar_t may increase the complexity of your code 
  because it involves concepts such as Unicode characters and multi-byte strings
5.it don't really help people read UTF-8 characters
  because UTF-8 span 1-4 bytes per character
  but wchar_t is 2 bytes at some platform like Unix-like System
